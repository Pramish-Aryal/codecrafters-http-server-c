# HTTP Server

Finished the [Codecrafters HTTP server](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) challenge in C.

Instructions:
Simply use
```bash
./your_program.sh
```
to run the program.

Dependencies:
- zlib (for gzip compression)

The code doesn't have any local tests because codecrafters did the testing for me :). Will add the tests in the future if/when the project
extends its current scope. (Check TODOs in main.c).

**Disclaimer**: This is mostly bad code written just to see how a http-server is written in C. Actual production code would look very different. I took a lot of shortcuts and have lots of "improvements" in mind :*.
